# Contributing

Contributions are welcome. This is, for now, a proof-of-concept, so feel free to hack on it.

## Getting Started

2. Clone your fork
3. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-addition`)
4. Make your changes
5. Test thoroughly in the extension development host
6. Commit your changes
7. Push to your fork
8. Open a Pull Request

## Development Setup

```bash
npm install
npm run compile
```

Then press F5 in VSCode to launch the extension development host.

## Code Style

- Clear variable names over brevity
- Comments for non-obvious logic
- Keep it simple - this is meant to be hackable

## Testing

Currently manual testing only. Test your changes by:
1. Creating sample prompts and datasets
2. Running evaluations in the development host
3. Verifying results are correctly captured

## Questions?

Open an issue to discuss your idea before implementing major changes.
